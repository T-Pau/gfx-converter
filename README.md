This is a toolbox I use for converting images to various
formats needed by my programs for 8-bit computers. It is not meant for general use, features and usage are not stable and may change without notice, depending on the needs of my projects.

It is written in C++17.

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for installation instructions and
dependencies.

If you want to reach the authors in private, use <gfx-convert@tpau.group>.
